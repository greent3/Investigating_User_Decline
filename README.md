# Investigating_User_Decline
Investigating a decline in Yammer's users users with SQL and Excel

I chose to use a Juypter notebook simply for presentation purposes. 

## TLDR
I concluded that :
 - Our (Yammer's) 2nd largest company of users (company2) had 50% less users on the week of 28July than on the week prior (reason unknown)
 - Company 2 is not satisfied with our app's current search functionality
 - The popularity of our weekly email blasts are decreasing
 
 And recommended that:
  - We reach out to company2 and get their feedback on our search functionality
  - We implement A/B testing for our email blasts
